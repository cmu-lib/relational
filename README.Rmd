# relational

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The goal of relational is to provide helper functions when loading R data frames into a database. While packages like DBI provide a general-purpose interface for loading individual tables, there's no general purpose approach

Right now, relational only supports SQLite backends.

## Installation

You can install relational from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dSHARP-CMU/relational")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```
